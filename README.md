- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m DÃ¡niel KertÃ©sz, welcome to my Work-In-Progress BI & Data Analytics Portfolio
- ðŸ‘€ As a data-driven BI Analyst, Iâ€™m passionate about turning raw data into interactive stories that spark insight and action. This portfolio highlights some of the personal and hobby projects I've built to sharpen my skills and explore data I'm genuinely curious about.
  
 #### ðŸš€ What You'll Find Here:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive dashboards built in Power BI**, exploring topics I find interesting.
- ðŸ§  **End-to-end workflows**: each project includes data sourcing, transformation (often in Power Query or Python), and visual storytelling.
- ðŸ’¡ **Demonstration of Python Pandas**:  leveraging the potentials of Pandas to manipulate and transform data, showcasing its powerful capabilities, while also creating a small interactive dashboard to visualize 
   the insights.
