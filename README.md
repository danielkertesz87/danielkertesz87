- 👋 Hi, I’m Dániel Kertész, BI Analyst
- 👀 I’m interested in extracting data from databases, and transforming it into actionable insights to support data-driven decisions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming and linear algebra to widen my data analytics toolkit and master more complex data science methods.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics projects, dashboards, and any initiatives that require extracting valuable insights from data.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: kertesz.daniel0303@gmail.com, LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-kertész-32b3039a
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like sports and music (especially live concerts). I'm an aviation fanatic (just from the ground 😀), and a hobby modeller. I've found a lot of similarities between building a plastic model and creating a dashboard 🙂
